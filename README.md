Flight Fare Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices utilizing machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing various flight details such as airline, source, destination, timing, and additional factors, the goal is to develop models that accurately forecast flight ticket prices.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The initial phase involved analyzing the dataset, identifying missing values, cleaning the data, and visualizing relationships between different features.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant information from date and time columns, handling categorical data, and scaling features for model training.
Model Building: Employing regression models such as Linear Regression, KNeighbors Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Improved model accuracy by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for the Random Forest model.
Conclusion: The dataset provides valuable insights into factors influencing flight prices, enabling informed pricing strategies for the aviation industry and assisting travelers in making informed decisions.

Usage
Environment Setup: Ensure necessary libraries are installed (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
Data: Obtain the flight dataset (not included here) and perform exploratory analysis as demonstrated in the notebook.
Model Training: Utilize various regression models mentioned in the notebook or experiment with other models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or similar techniques to optimize model performance.
Deployment: Save the trained model for future predictions using joblib or pickle.

Note
IDE Support: For full support and editing capabilities of Jupyter notebooks, consider using PyCharm Professional, DataSpell, or Datalore by JetBrains.
Model Saving: The trained model (tuned_random_forest_model.pkl) has been saved for further use.
